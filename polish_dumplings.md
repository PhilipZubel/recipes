# Polish Dumplings

## Ingredients:

Around 60 dumplings:

- dough (proportions need to be exact):
  - boiling water: 250-280ml
  - plain flour: 500g
  - oil (preferably olive): 4 spoons
- filling (you can be more flexible):
  - potatoes: 500g
  - quark cheese (twar√≥g): 300g
  - brown onions: x2 big
  - red chili(s)
- garnish:
  - brown/red onions (or) 
  - bacon (or)
  - spring onions

## Method:

1. Boil the potatoes and mash them up. In the meantime fry one brown onion and and chili peppers.
2. Mix mashed potatoes with the fried onions and the cheese. Put salt and pepper.
   **Tip:** Make sure the filling is slightly spicier than what you consider ideal because the dough is plain.
3. To make the dough, form the flower in a shape of a volcano. Add the oil to the flour and pour a bit of the water into the flour. Mix the water with the flour and put the wet flour on the side. Repeat this process until you run out of water.
4. Mix the dough together until it's well combined.
   **Tip**: The dough dries quite fast and it needs to be sticky in order to close it. If you don't want the dough to dry, put a wet cloth on top. 
5. Roll the dough evenly in a shape of a sausage and cut the dough into small circular shapes. 
6. Use the rolling pin to flatten the doughs and add a hefty tea spoon of the filling.
7. You can fold dumplings in different shapes. The simplest approach is to fold it in half and gently squeeze the side that needs to be attached. [Example Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi#/media/File:Pierogi_z_cebulk%C4%85.jpg)
8. Boil slightly salted water. Boil the dumplings and reduce the heat to low. When the dumplings start floating, boil for 2-3 minutes.
9. In the meantime, cut the garnish into small cubes and fry it on a pan. 
10. Enjoy :)
