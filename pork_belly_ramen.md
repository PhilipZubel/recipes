# Pork Belly Ramen

## Ingredients:

2 Servings:

- 1 tsp five spice
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
- 2 eggs
- 2 garlic cloves
- 15g ginger
- 2 tbsp white miso paste
- 300g pork belly
- toasted sesame seeds
- soy sauce
- 2 spring onions
- 2 noodle nests
- 1 carrot

## Method:

1. Preheat oven to 160 (fan)
2. Boil a kettle
3. Score the fatty side of the pork belly in a criss cross pattern using a knife, making sure the knife is deep enough to reach the meat below
4. Combine the 5 spice, 1 tsp salt and 1 tbsp of vegetable oil in a small bowl
5. Rub the mix deep into the criss cross pattern
6. Heat a pan over a medium heat and add the pork belly fat-side down and cook until nicely coloured (~3-5 mins), then flip and cook for 2 mins on the other side
7. Transfer the pork belly fat side up onto a foil-covered baking tray and add 300ml of boiled water
8. Put the tray in the oven for 40-45 until it's nice and crispy and yummy
9. Add the eggs to a pot of boiling water and cook for ~7 mins, then add them to a bowl of ice so they don't overcook
10. Peel and finely chop the ginger and garlic, slice the spring onions finely and peel the carrots until you end up with carrot ribbons
11. Boil the kettle again
12. Transfer the pork belly to a chopping board once it's cooked and leave for 5-10 mins
13. Heat a pot over a medium heat with 1 tbsp of vegetable oil and add the ginger and garlic
14. Add the miso paste, soy sauce, chilli flakes, 1 tsp of sugar and 600ml of boiled water
15. Add any resting juices from the baking tray to the broth, then add the noodles and cook for 5-7 mins
16. Peel and cut the eggs in half, and slice the pork belly as thinly as you can
17. Divide the broth and toppings between the two bowls
18. Enjoy your meal. OR ELSE.
